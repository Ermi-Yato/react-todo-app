Frontend Mentor - Todo App
This is a complete solution to the Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor. It's a basic todo application with a few/basic functionalities, built to be fully responsive and accessible.

Features
-> Add, Delete, and Complete Todos: Users can manage their tasks with a clean and intuitive interface.

-> Filterable List: View all tasks, or filter by "Active" or "Completed" status.

-> "Clear Completed" Button: Easily remove all completed tasks from the list with a single click.

-> Light & Dark Mode Toggle: Switch between a light and dark theme to suit your preference.

-> Local Storage Persistence: Your theme preference and the entire list of todos are saved in the browser, so your data is waiting for you when you return.

Technologies Used
React: A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: Adds static typing to JavaScript to improve code quality

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and custom UI development.

Vite: A fast and modern front-end build tool.


----- WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT -----
Building this app was essential in solidifying my understanding of React. I now have a much clearer grasp of how to use components to build a better application and how to effectively manage state and side effects with the useState and useEffect hooks.
